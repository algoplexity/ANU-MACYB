Based on Proposal v5, here is the precise narrative you are constructing for your ANU audience (Supervisors, Reviewers, and Sponsors).

This narrative is designed to position you not just as a student building a gadget, but as a researcher addressing **National Priorities** through the unique lens of **ANU Cybernetics**.

### The Core Hook: "Solving the Siting Bottleneck"
**"We have the technology to reach Net Zero. We have the capital (the $1B Solar Sunshot). What we lack is the *Social Technology* to agree on where to put it."**

Your project argues that the Australian Energy Transition is no longer an engineering problem; it is a **Cybernetic Problem**. The grid is ready, but the *social network* is tripping.

### Pillar 1: Alignment with the National University Mission (Public Policy & ACES)
**The Narrative:**
> "The Civic Resonator addresses the 'Institutional Structural Deficit' identified by the **ANU Centre for Energy Systems (ACES)**.
>
> We are moving the conversation from 'Social License' (a vague feeling) to a **'Social Dynamic Operating Envelope' (a quantifiable system state)**.
>
> Just as the electrical grid has voltage limits (Operating Envelopes) to prevent blackouts, communities have tension limits to prevent planning gridlock. This device provides the 'Social Voltmeter' required to navigate the **Nelson Wetlands** conflict and unlock the solar infrastructure pipeline. It operationalises **Doyne Farmer’s Complexity Economics** to prove that trust is a 'grid asset' that creates economic value."

*   **Key Keywords for this audience:** *Siting Bottleneck, Social Dynamic Operating Envelope (DOE), Green-on-Green Conflict, Institutional Deficit.*

---

### Pillar 2: Alignment with the School of Cybernetics (Systems & Responsibility)
**The Narrative:**
> "This project is a canonical Cybernetic system. It bridges the 'Hard' (Embedded Systems, Graph Theory) and the 'Soft' (Sociology, Leadership Dynamics).
>
> It rejects the 'Rational Agent' model of economics. Instead, it enforces **Bounded Rationality** via a hardware interface that strips away complex language, forcing stakeholders to rely on rhythm and signal—the primitive physics of **Collective Intelligence**.
>
> Crucially, it demonstrates **Reflexivity**. It does not claim to 'solve' the wetlands; it acts as a mirror (Resonator) that allows the system to observe its own entropy, facilitating the **'Negative Capability'** taught in the **ANU Leadership Complexity Lab**."

*   **Key Keywords for this audience:** *Bounded Rationality, Third-Order Cybernetics, Reflexivity, Negative Capability, Hysteresis.*

---

### Pillar 3: Alignment with the "Great Agentic Transition" (Future Engineering)
**The Narrative:**
> "We are preparing for the 2026 reality of **Agentic Engineering**. This project demonstrates a 'Paper2Code' pipeline where humans act as Architects and AI Agents (DeepCode/NanoClaw) act as Builders.
>
> However, we also address the safety crisis. By using the Civic Resonator as a **'Physical Constitution,'** we demonstrate how to safely deploy autonomous AI agents into human negotiations. The hardware acts as a 'Rate Limiter' and 'Containment Sandbox,' ensuring that AI agents can facilitate consensus without overriding human agency."

*   **Key Keywords for this audience:** *Agentic Engineering, Hardware-in-the-Loop Governance, Physical Constitution, Paper2Code.*

---

### The Closing Argument (The "Why")

"The Civic Resonator is **Experiment Zero** for a new type of governance infrastructure. It proves that we can use Cyber-Physical Systems to lower the metabolic cost of agreement, turning the friction of the **Green Energy Transition** into the fuel for **Endogenous Learning**."

This narrative connects:
1.  **The Past:** Indigenous/Ecological knowledge (Nelson Wetlands).
2.  **The Present:** Grid Engineering constraints (ACES).
3.  **The Future:** Agentic AI Governance (Cybernetics).

This is a winning narrative for the Australian National University.
