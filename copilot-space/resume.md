## PROFESSIONAL PROFILE

Analyst with integrated capability across economic modelling, statistical analysis, enterprise
systems architecture and regulatory analytics. Background spans the Australian Public Service,
large-scale operational systems, quantitative financial engineering and current cyber-physical
energy systems modelling at the Australian National University.
Positioned to contribute to economic analysis, energy statistics, market modelling and strategic
advisory functions within Australia’s energy transition.

## EDUCATION

### Australian National University

**Master of Applied Cybernetics (Full-Time)**
Focus: Complex systems, socio-technical modelling, cyber-physical systems, policy-facing
systems design
Current Project: **Civic Resonator (CPS v5)**

- Modelling feedback between infrastructure constraints, behavioural adoption and economic
incentives
- Developing structured simulation architecture for energy system trade-off analysis
- Applying systems methods to real-world transition challenges (e.g., Nelsons Wetlands case)

### WorldQuant University


**Master of Science in Financial Engineering**
Capstone Thesis: _Algorithmic Intelligence_

- Structural break detection in dynamic markets
- Optimisation under constraints
- Time-series modelling and stochastic processes
- Scenario stress-testing and regime analysis
Relevance: Complex market modelling transferable to electricity, gas and transport sectors.
